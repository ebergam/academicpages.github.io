I am pursuing a PhD in Economics at Collegio Carlo Alberto (Turin) and working as Research Fellow at the University of Milan-Bicocca.

Prior to starting the PhD, I worked at the European think tank Bruegel ([publications](https://bruegel.org/author/enrico-bergamini)).

I am an applied econmists and data scientists, working mainly on green industrial policy, economic geography, policy uncertainty, and computational social science. 

I have a strong interest in spatial data science, networks, NLP, scraping and non-conventional (big) data sources (like newspaper archives).

My publications are listed on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qedxNoIAAAAJ&hl=en).
