I am a fourth year PhD Candidate in Economics and Complexity, at the "Vilfredo Pareto" Doctorate Program at Collegio Carlo Alberto, in Turin.

After visiting the [ICTA](https://www.uab.cat/icta/) research center at Universitat Autonoma Barcelona, I am now visiting the [AQR](http://www.ub.edu/aqr/index.php) research group at Universitat de Barcelona. 

I am working under the supervision of Francesco Quatraro (UniTo) and Jeroen van den Bergh (ICTA-UAB).

Prior to starting the PhD, I worked for the European think tank [Bruegel](https://bruegel.org/author/enrico-bergamini). 

I am an applied researcher, now working on Evolutionary Economic Geography, Foreign Direct Investments, climate policy and innovation. 
Methodologically, I have a strong interest in spatial analysis, Natural Language Processing, and the use of non-conventional (big) data sources.
