I am a third-year PhD Candidate in Economics and Complexity, at the "Vilfredo Pareto" Doctorate Program at Collegio Carlo Alberto, in Turin, currently visiting the ICTA research center at Universitat Autonoma Barcelona. I am working under the supervision of Francesco Quatraro (UniTo) and Jeroen van den Bergh (ICTA-UAB).

Prior to starting the PhD, I worked for the European think tank [Bruegel](https://bruegel.org/author/enrico-bergamini). 

I am an applied researcher, mainly working on Economics of innovation, climate, and green industrial policies. Methodologically, I have a strong interest in spatial analysis, and the use of non-conventional (big) data sources.
