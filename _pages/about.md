I am a fourth year PhD Candidate in Economics and Complexity, at the "Vilfredo Pareto" Doctorate Program at Collegio Carlo Alberto, in Turin.

After visiting the [ICTA](https://www.uab.cat/icta/) research center at Universitat Autonoma Barcelona, I am now visiting the [AQR](http://www.ub.edu/aqr/index.php) research group at Universitat de Barcelona. 

I am working under the supervision of Francesco Quatraro (UniTo) and Jeroen van den Bergh (ICTA-UAB).

Prior to starting the PhD, I worked for the European think tank [Bruegel](https://bruegel.org/author/enrico-bergamini). 

I am an applied researcher, now working on Economic Complexity, green innovation, Foreign Direct Investments and Climate Policy.

Methodologically, I have a strong interest in spatial analysis, network analysis, Natural Language Processing, and the use of non-conventional (big) data sources.

My publications are listed on [Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qedxNoIAAAAJ&hl=en), and you can download my curriculum [here](/CV_EnricoBergamini.pdf).
