I am a first year PhD Candidate in Economics and Complexity, at the "Vilfredo Pareto" Doctorate Program at Collegio Carlo Alberto, in Turin. Before this, I was writing for a [think tank](https://bruegel.org/author/enrico-bergamini). I am interested in applied research and data science, in fields including economics of innovation, industrial policy, climate change economics, political economy and media economics. You can check out some of my work [here](/publications), and take a look at my CV [here](/CV).
